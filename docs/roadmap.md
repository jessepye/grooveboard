# Project Roadmap: Simple Collaborative Whiteboard

**Vision:** An extremely simple, instant-access, real-time collaborative whiteboard, built on a scalable and fault-tolerant cloud-native architecture, with options for user accounts and a premium ad-free experience. Designed for ease of use, even for younger users, by maintaining a single, non-zoomable page interface.

## Phase 1: Core Drawing & Real-time Anonymous Collaboration Foundation

* **Milestone 1: Basic Real-time Drawing on AWS**
    * **Goal:** Establish the simplest possible drawing functionality shared in real-time between anonymous users, with an initial focus on backend architecture.
    * **Key Features (Frontend - Ultra Simple):**
        * Single, non-zoomable canvas.
        * Basic Pen Tool: Draw freehand lines (default color/thickness).
        * Eraser Tool (Basic): Erase drawings.
        * Clear Board button.
    * **Key Architecture & Backend Tasks:**
        * **AWS Setup:** Basic VPC, EC2 instances (or EKS LATER, start simple if needed), and necessary security groups.
        * **Microservice 1 (Collaboration Service):**
            * Develop a WebSocket service (e.g., using Node.js with `ws` or Python with FastAPI/Starlette).
            * Handles real-time broadcasting of drawing data (coordinates, tool actions).
            * Containerize this service (Docker).
        * **Initial Deployment:** Deploy the containerized Collaboration Service to AWS (e.g., ECS or a single EC2 instance initially for simplicity before full Kubernetes).
        * **Frontend:** Basic web client that connects to the WebSocket service and renders drawings.
    * **User Experience:**
        * Users visit the site and are instantly on a new, unique, shareable whiteboard.
        * No accounts needed for this phase.
    * **Design Concepts to Focus On:**
        * **Minimalist UI/UX:** Absolute simplicity.
        * **Client-Server Architecture (Real-time):** WebSocket communication patterns.
        * **Containerization (Docker):** Basics of creating Dockerfiles and managing images.
        * **AWS Fundamentals:** EC2, S3 (for static frontend hosting), basic networking.
        * **Data Serialization:** Efficiently sending drawing data.
    * **Outcome:** Two anonymous users can open a unique board URL and see each other's simple drawings and erasures in real-time. The backend service is containerized and running on AWS.

## Phase 2: Scalability, Board Persistence & Basic Ad Integration

* **Milestone 2: Introduction to Kubernetes, Board Naming/Saving (for Anonymous Users), and Initial Ad Display**
    * **Goal:** Enhance scalability using Kubernetes, allow anonymous users to "name" or get a persistent link to their boards, and introduce the first layer of monetization.
    * **Key Features & Tasks:**
        * **Board Identification/Persistence (Simple):**
            * Allow users to claim a unique, memorable URL or ID for their board (still anonymous).
            * **Microservice 2 (Persistence Service - Basic):**
                * Handles saving/loading board states (drawing data) to a database (e.g., AWS DynamoDB or RDS).
                * Containerize this service.
        * **Kubernetes (EKS):**
            * Set up an Amazon EKS cluster.
            * Deploy the Collaboration Service and Persistence Service to EKS.
            * Learn basics of `kubectl`, deployments, services, and ingress.
        * **Ad Integration (Frontend):**
            * Integrate a simple ad network (e.g., Google AdSense) to display ads on the whiteboard page for all users.
    * **User Experience:**
        * Users can still access boards instantly and anonymously.
        * They can now get a specific link to return to a board or share it more permanently.
        * Ads are visible on the page.
    * **Design Concepts to Focus On:**
        * **Microservices Architecture:** Communication between services (e.g., Collaboration service might notify Persistence service).
        * **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
        * **Database Design (NoSQL or SQL):** For storing board data.
        * **API Design:** For interactions between frontend, collaboration service, and persistence service.
        * **Fault Tolerance (Basic):** How Kubernetes helps with pod restarts, etc.
        * **Stateless vs. Stateful Services:** Considerations for your microservices.
    * **Outcome:** The application runs on Kubernetes in AWS. Anonymous users can have semi-persistent boards via unique IDs. Ads are displayed.

## Phase 3: User Accounts & Premium Features

* **Milestone 3: User Authentication, Saved Boards for Registered Users, and Ad-Free Option**
    * **Goal:** Implement user accounts for saving boards and settings, and introduce a paid tier to remove ads.
    * **Key Features & Tasks:**
        * **Microservice 3 (Authentication Service):**
            * Handle user registration and login (e.g., using AWS Cognito or a custom solution with JWTs).
            * Containerize this service and deploy to EKS.
        * **Account Features:**
            * Registered users can save boards to their account.
            * Dashboard for registered users to see their saved boards.
            * (Optional) User-specific settings (e.g., default pen color).
        * **Microservice 4 (Subscription/Payment Service - or Integration):**
            * Integrate with a payment provider (e.g., Stripe, Paddle).
            * Manage user subscriptions for an ad-free experience.
            * Containerize if custom, or configure integration.
        * **Conditional Ad Display:** Logic to hide ads for subscribed users.
    * **User Experience:**
        * Users can still use the service anonymously with ads.
        * Option to create an account to save boards and settings.
        * Logged-in users can pay to remove ads.
    * **Design Concepts to Focus On:**
        * **Authentication & Authorization Patterns:** Securely managing user identities and permissions.
        * **Secure API Design:** Protecting user data and endpoints.
        * **Database Relationships:** Linking users to their boards and subscription status.
        * **Third-party API Integration (Payments):** Webhooks, security, idempotency.
        * **System Scalability & Resilience:** Ensuring the multi-service architecture is robust.
        * **CI/CD Pipelines (Introduction):** Start thinking about automating builds and deployments to EKS.
    * **Outcome:** A fully-featured application with anonymous access, user accounts, saved boards for registered users, and a working ad-based and subscription-based monetization model, all running on a scalable AWS EKS infrastructure.

            * Implement centralized logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, ELK stack).
            * Set up monitoring and alerting (e.g., CloudWatch Metrics/Alarms, Prometheus/Grafana).
        * **Performance Optimization:**
            * Identify and address bottlenecks in frontend or backend services.
            * Database query optimization.
            * Content Delivery Network (CDN) for frontend assets (AWS CloudFront).
        * **Cost Optimization:**
