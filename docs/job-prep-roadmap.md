# 5-Day Job Prep Roadmap: OpenTelemetry + Tech Stack

## Overview
Intensive preparation for upcoming job role focusing on OpenTelemetry and observability stack. Dedicating 2 hours daily for practical hands-on learning.

**Target Tech Stack:**
- **Languages**: Java, Python, Golang
- **Frontend**: React, Angular, Node.js
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, M3DB
- **Logging**: OpenSearch (transitioning from Elastic + Splunk)
- **Analytics**: ClickHouse
- **Focus**: OpenTelemetry (OTel) - beginner level Java and Golang

## Day 1: OpenTelemetry Foundations (React/Node.js)
**Focus: Get hands-on with OTel in familiar territory**

### Tasks:
- Install `@opentelemetry/api` and `@opentelemetry/sdk-web` in GrooveBoard
- Instrument canvas drawing operations (traces for stroke events)
- Add basic metrics (stroke count, page switches, WebSocket events)
- Set up console exporter to see telemetry data

### Learning Goals:
- Understand OTel core concepts: Traces, Spans, Metrics
- Practice instrumentation in familiar React environment
- See telemetry data flow in action

### Deliverable:
Working React app with OTel instrumentation showing drawing operation traces

## Day 2: Java Fundamentals + OTel Java
**Focus: Java basics with immediate OTel application**

### Tasks:
- Java crash course: syntax, classes, Spring Boot basics
- Create simple Java WebSocket service for GrooveBoard backend
- Add OpenTelemetry Java SDK (`opentelemetry-java`)
- Instrument HTTP endpoints and WebSocket connections

### Learning Goals:
- Java fundamentals for backend development
- OTel Java SDK usage and auto-instrumentation
- Spring Boot + OTel integration patterns

### Deliverable:
Working Java WebSocket service with OTel instrumentation

## Day 3: Golang Fundamentals + OTel Go
**Focus: Go basics with OTel integration**

### Tasks:
- Go crash course: syntax, goroutines, HTTP servers
- Build simple Go microservice (metrics aggregator)
- Add OpenTelemetry Go SDK (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel`)
- Implement distributed tracing between React → Java → Go

### Learning Goals:
- Go language fundamentals
- OTel Go SDK manual instrumentation
- Distributed tracing across multiple services
- Context propagation between services

### Deliverable:
Multi-language distributed tracing demo (React → Java → Go)

## Day 4: OTel Collector + Prometheus
**Focus: Production-ready observability pipeline**

### Tasks:
- Set up OpenTelemetry Collector (otel-collector-contrib)
- Configure receivers, processors, exporters
- Connect to Prometheus for metrics storage
- Set up M3DB as Prometheus remote storage

### Learning Goals:
- OTel Collector architecture and configuration
- OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) usage
- Prometheus integration patterns
- M3DB as scalable metrics backend

### Deliverable:
Complete metrics pipeline: Apps → OTel Collector → Prometheus → M3DB

## Day 5: Complete Stack Integration
**Focus: ClickHouse + OpenSearch + Review**

### Tasks:
- Set up ClickHouse for analytics data
- Configure OpenSearch for log aggregation
- Review entire observability stack
- Prepare talking points about OTel architecture

### Learning Goals:
- ClickHouse for fast analytics queries
- OpenSearch for centralized logging
- End-to-end observability architecture
- Interview preparation and knowledge consolidation

### Deliverable:
Complete observability stack demonstration and architecture overview

## Key OpenTelemetry Concepts to Master

### Core Components:
- **Traces**: Request flow through distributed systems
- **Spans**: Individual operations within a trace
- **Metrics**: Numerical measurements over time
- **Logs**: Structured log records with trace correlation

### Advanced Concepts:
- **Context Propagation**: Passing trace context between services
- **Sampling**: Controlling data volume and performance impact
- **Baggage**: Cross-cutting concerns data propagation
- **Resource Detection**: Automatic service metadata collection

### OTel Stack Components:
- **OTel SDK**: Language-specific instrumentation libraries
- **OTel Collector**: Vendor-agnostic telemetry data pipeline
- **OTLP**: OpenTelemetry Protocol for data transmission
- **Auto-instrumentation**: Automatic framework/library instrumentation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Can explain OTel architecture and benefits
- [ ] Hands-on experience with OTel in 3 languages (JS/TS, Java, Go)
- [ ] Working distributed tracing demo
- [ ] Complete observability pipeline setup
- [ ] Ready to discuss OTel in technical interviews
