**Project Goal:** Create a simple, collaborative whiteboard focused on core functionality. It's a portfolio project to showcase software engineering skills, particularly in backend architecture.

**Core User Experience:**

- Extremely simple, intuitive interface (target: usable by an 11-year-old).
- Single, non-zoomable page/canvas per board.
- Instant, account-free access for basic use.
- Optional sign-in to save boards/settings.
- Monetization via ads (for free users) and a paid ad-free tier.

**Key Technical Architecture Focus:**

- Scalable and fault-tolerant backend.
- Microservices architecture.
- Containerization (e.g., Docker).
- Orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Hosted on AWS.

**Development Methodology:**

Crucially, all development advice, code suggestions, and planning should adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Please emphasize writing tests before writing implementation code.
